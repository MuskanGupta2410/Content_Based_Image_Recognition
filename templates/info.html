                    <h5>Image Retrieval:</h5>
                    <p>In this digital era, image repository is increasing at a tremendous rate. First of all, people have a comparative ease of access to image capturing devices such as smartphones, digital cameras and scanning devices, then what it used to be a few years ago. Not only this, massive amount of data is also generated from medical sciences and satellite imaging every single day. The collection of images available on the internet is also growing at a much faster pace. “According to a study, there are 180 million images on the Web, a total amount of image data of about 3Tb along with 1 million or more digital images are being produced every single day”.Image retrieval performed by matching the feature of a query image with images in the dataset, has become a problem of interest to many people. A lot of research study has been going on in this field to develop systems and tools that shall enable efficient and accurate image browsing and retrieval. For instance, Flipkart had initiated image search on its website but later shut it down in less than a year of its launch because the results that it produced were a lot of times irrelevant and customers did not cater interest in this feature. We therefore, looked into various on going developments in this field and implemented a system that can provide as much best results possible.</p>
                    <h5>Content Based Image Retrieval:</h5>
                    <p>CBIR overcomes the limitations of Text Based Retrieval whereby the retrieval occurs on the actual “content” of images that is visible. CBIR works with low-level features such as color, shape or texture.

                        When building an image search engine we will first have to index our dataset. Indexing a dataset is the process of quantifying our dataset by utilizing an image descriptor to extract features from each image. An image descriptor defines the algorithm that we are utilizing to describe our image.The important takeaway here is that the image descriptor governs how the image is quantified. Features, on the other hand, are the output of an image descriptor. When you put an image into an image descriptor, you will get features out the other end. In the most basic terms, features (or feature vectors) are just a list of numbers used to abstractly represent and quantify images.Feature vectors can then be compared for similarity by using a distance metric or similarity function. Distance metrics and similarity functions take two feature vectors as inputs and then output a number that represents how “similar” the two feature vectors are. Given two feature vectors, a distance function is used to determine how similar the two feature vectors are. The output of the distance function is a single floating point value used to represent the similarity between the two images.</p>
